🧱 CREATIONAL DESIGN PATTERNS — INTERVIEW ORIENTED
Creational patterns deal with object creation logic — ensuring flexibility, decoupling, and correctness in how objects are created.
There are 5 main patterns:
Singleton


Factory Method


Abstract Factory


Builder


Prototype



1️⃣ Singleton Pattern
✅ Definition
Ensures only one instance of a class exists in the entire application and provides a global access point to it.
🎯 Interview Scenarios
Database Connection Pool


Logger instance


Configuration manager (config.yaml, env values)


Cache manager (Redis, in-memory LRU)


Thread pool executor


🧠 When to Use
Use Singleton when:
You need exactly one instance


You need centralized control


Instance should be reused (avoid new allocations)


🔑 Memory Trick
“One object for entire application — Singleton.”

2️⃣ Factory Method Pattern
✅ Definition
Defines an interface for object creation but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
🎯 Interview Scenarios
Notification service (SMS, Email, Push)


Payment method selection (UPI, Card, NetBanking)


Message parser (JSON, XML, YAML)


Cloud provider selection (AWS, GCP, Azure)


🧠 When to Use
Use Factory Method when:
You want different implementations of same interface


You don’t want client to know object-construction details


You want to add new types without modifying existing code


🔑 Memory Trick
“One interface, many implementations.”

3️⃣ Abstract Factory Pattern
✅ Definition
Provides an interface to create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
🎯 Interview Scenarios
UI Themes (DarkTheme → DarkButton, DarkCheckbox)


Payment Gateways (Razorpay → UPI, NetBanking, Card)


Multi-Cloud services (AWS → S3, SNS, Lambda)


Operating systems (Windows Factory → WinButton, WinFileSystem)


🧠 When to Use
Use Abstract Factory when:
Objects come in related families


You must ensure consistency of family
 (e.g., RazorpayUPI + RazorpayNetBanking, not PaytmUPI + RazorpayNetBanking)


🔑 Memory Trick
“Factory of factories — grouped products.”

4️⃣ Builder Pattern
✅ Definition
Separates object construction from representation, allowing step-by-step construction of complex objects.
🎯 Interview Scenarios
Building a complex HTTP Request object


Constructing SQL queries (SELECT → WHERE → ORDER BY)


Creating large objects like:


UserProfile


Report


Vehicle (engine → seats → GPS → type)


Creating immutable objects


🧠 When to Use
Use Builder when:
Object has too many parameters


Object requires step-by-step construction


You want immutable objects


Construction logic is complex and conditional


🔑 Memory Trick
“Step-by-step construction of complex objects.”

5️⃣ Prototype Pattern
✅ Definition
Creates objects by cloning existing objects (deep copy or shallow copy).
🎯 Interview Scenarios
Large object creation is expensive (big configurations)


Caching frequently used objects


Document editor → copy & paste


Game development → clone enemy, NPC, weapon configs


Machine Learning → cloning model config templates


🧠 When to Use
Use Prototype when:
Object creation cost is high


You need cloning instead of creating from scratch


🔑 Memory Trick
“Copy, don’t create.”

🧠 Final Interview Cheat Sheet (One-Line Summary)
Pattern
One Line Definition
Best Scenario
Singleton
Only one instance, globally accessible
Logger, Config, DB connection
Factory Method
One interface → many implementations
Payment, Notification, Parser
Abstract Factory
Factory of factories (family of related objects)
UI themes, Payment gateways
Builder
Step-by-step construction
Complex object creation
Prototype
Clone objects instead of creating
Expensive object creation


🎯 How to Answer in Interview (2-Minute Perfect Answer)
“Creational patterns solve object creation problems.
 Singleton ensures only one instance exists — used in DB connections or config.
 Factory Method lets subclasses decide which object to create — perfect when choosing payment types or notifications.
 Abstract Factory creates families of related objects — like RazorpayUPI + RazorpayNetBanking.
 Builder constructs complex objects step-by-step, like building a heavy HTTP request.
 Prototype clones existing objects when creation cost is high.”
